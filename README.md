# Instagram-link-extractor

This repository contains two JavaScript scripts to extract post and reel links from Instagram collection pages.

## Scripts

### 1. Console Link Logger (`console_links.js`)
- Collects all post and reel links from the current Instagram page.
- Prints them in the console, one per line, for easy copying.

### 2. File Downloader (`download_links.js`)
- Collects all post and reel links from the current Instagram page.
- Saves the links into a `.txt` file, preserving the order of appearance.
- The filename includes the collection name for easy identification.

Both scripts are designed to be run directly in the browser console while browsing Instagram collections.
